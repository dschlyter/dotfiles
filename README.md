Dotfiles
========

Various dotfiles I use.

Installation
------------

There is an installation script that sets (almost) everything up. It mostly just symlinks these into your home directory, with different files used on different platforms.

Run ´./install.sh` for basic install or ´./install.sh --vundle` to also install vim vundle plugins.

OS X
----

Also run ./osx.sh for some sane default configs.

To use iterm2-settings, open iterm preferences and select load config from file and select com.googlecode.iterm2.plist in this dir. To export config, open iterm preferences and press save config to file.
