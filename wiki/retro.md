## How do you do a retro:

First of all, KISS is usually best

1. Follow up previous action items
2. Write cards: happy, sad, curious
3. Vote and discuss, create action items

### Team health check

Before we start, a checkin with some core metrics.

- We have a clear mission
- We are making progress
- We maintain high quality
- We collaborate well
- Work is fun

I like it but it also seems teams have fallen off the bandwagon fairly quickly.

Tools
    - Menti works but free plan is limiting.
    - Google sheets with forms work well if you do some SQL and charts (I have a template)

### Other things to spice it up

* A simple rephrasing of the basics - I love, I wish, I wonder
* The sailboat - sun, clouds, wind, anchor, island, icebergs
* Dixit cards!
